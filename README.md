# Clip_Nightbot: Stream Clipping Simplified

The primary goal of Clip_Nightbot is to streamline the clipping process, addressing challenges faced by one of my favorite streamers. Here's how you can make the most of it:
## Monetization
This program is a free for small streamers (have less than 40 viewers) and for selected people. </br>

Most of the donations goes back to development and hosting costing. 
## Nightbot Command:

```markdown
!addcom !clip $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/clip/$(chatid)/$(querystring))
```
Just adding this command will get you started. but if you want to have a discord message. or customization then read below.

If you want to send a discord message. then I would need to add a webhook URL alongside the youtube channel ID. for that contact me here.<br>

## Optional Arguments:

- `showlink` (default: true) - Display the link where all clips can be viewed.
- `screenshot` (default: false) - Enable or disable screenshot capture. If enabled the nightbot may not get response in given time and will say "Timed out" message. but it will still clip.
- `delay` (default: 0) - Introduce an artificial delay to the command. Useful for scheduling links in the future or past.
- `silent` (default: 2||Highest) - Level of the clipping message. see example below.

### Examples:

- `https://streamsnip.com/clip/$(chatid)/$(querystring)?showlink=false&screenshot=false` - No links, no screenshots.
- `https://streamsnip.com/clip/$(chatid)/$(querystring)?showlink=false` - No links, but with screenshots.
- `https://streamsnip.com/clip/$(chatid)/$(querystring)?screenshot=false` - Links provided, no screenshots.
- `https://streamsnip.com/clip/$(chatid)/$(querystring)?delay=-20` - Set a delay in the past by 20 seconds.

## Other Commands
1. `!delete <clip_id>` - delete the given clip
```markdown
!addcom !delete $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/delete/$(query)) -ul=moderator
```
⚠️ don't remove the `-ul=moderator` part, otherwise anyone can delete your clips. </br>

2. `!edit <clip_id> <new_title>` - edit the title of the given clip
```markdown
!addcom !edit $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/edit/$(querystring)) -ul=moderator
```
⚠️ don't remove the `-ul=moderator` part, otherwise anyone can delete your clips. </br>

3. `!clips` or `!export` - gives link where you can see all the clips 
```markdown
!addcom !export $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/export)
```

4. `!cliptest` - test if the clipper is working, basically checks if the website is reachable.
```markdown
!addcom !cliptest $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/)
```

#### Super Advanced, Proceed with caution here
5. `!search` gives the last clip that had the query in in it
 ```markdown
 !addcom !search $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/search/$(querystring))
```
SUPER PRO MODE </br>
Idea from [here](https://community.nightdev.com/t/clip-command-then-have-lastclip-automatically-update/35360), You can combine !search command to give out timestamp to particular events in the stream </br>
A combo can look like this 
```
!addcom !clipkill $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/clip/$(chatid)/kill-automated)
!addcom !lastkill $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/search/kill-automated)
```
Want more advanced ? here </br>
There is one more endpoint named `/searchx/<clip-desc>` that returns JSON of the clip with that clip-desc.</br>
THIS IS JUST 1 EXAMPLE. SKY IS THE LIMIT HERE
```
!addcom !lastkilltime $(eval clip=$(urlfetch json https://streamsnip.com/searchx/kill-automated); clip['hms'])
```
You can see example of `clip` from Raw-Data on site.
### Additional Customization:

You can use `-ul=userlevel` to limit clipping to specific user levels (e.g., mods). Find user levels [here](https://docs.nightbot.tv/commands/commands#advanced-usage) to reduce spam and grant clipping access to specific individuals.  </br>
