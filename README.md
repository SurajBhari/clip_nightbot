The primary goal of Clip_Nightbot is to streamline the clipping process, addressing challenges faced by one of my favorite streamers. Here's how you can make the most of it:
## Monetization
This program is a free for small streamers (have less than 40 viewers) and for selected people. </br>
<a href="https://surajbhari.stck.me" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" style="height: 41px !important;width: 174px !important;box-shadow: 0px 3px 2px 0px rgba(190, 190, 190, 0.5) !important;-webkit-box-shadow: 0px 3px 2px 0px rgba(190, 190, 190, 0.5) !important;" ></a> </br>
Most of the donations goes back to development and hosting costing. 
## Nightbot Command:

```markdown
!addcom !clip $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/clip/$(chatid)/$(querystring))
```
Just adding this command will get you started. but if you want to have a discord message. or customization then read below.

If you want to send a discord message. then I would need to add a webhook URL alongside the youtube channel ID. for that contact me here.<br>

## Optional Arguments:

- `showlink` (default: true) - Display the link where all clips can be viewed.
- `screenshot` (default: false) - Enable or disable screenshot capture. If enabled the nightbot may not get response in given time and will say "Timed out" message. but it will still clip.
- `delay` (default: 0) - Introduce an artificial delay to the command. Useful for scheduling links in the future or past.
- `silent` (default: 2||Highest) - Level of the clipping message. see example below. </br>

- `private` (default: false) - If set to true. the clips made are not shown on the web nor impact stats. if you don't want your channel to show up on website. you use it.

4. `!cliptest` - test if the clipper is working, basically checks if the website is reachable.
```markdown
!addcom !cliptest $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/)
```

#### Super Advanced, Proceed with caution here
5. `!search` gives the last clip that had the query in in it
 ```markdown
 !addcom !search $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/search/$(querystring))
```
SUPER PRO MODE </br>
Idea from [here](https://community.nightdev.com/t/clip-command-then-have-lastclip-automatically-update/35360), You can combine !search command to give out timestamp to particular events in the stream </br>
A combo can look like this 
```
!addcom !clipkill $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/clip/$(chatid)/kill-automated)
!addcom !lastkill $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/search/kill-automated)
```
Want more advanced ? here </br>
There is one more endpoint named `/searchx/<clip-desc>` that returns JSON of the clip with that clip-desc.</br>
THIS IS JUST 1 EXAMPLE. SKY IS THE LIMIT HERE
```
!addcom !lastkilltime $(eval clip=$(urlfetch json https://streamsnip.com/searchx/kill-automated); clip['hms'])
```
returning data looks something like this </br>

6. `!uptime` gives uptime of the latest stream of the channel that called this command
   ```markdown
   !addcom !uptime $(urlfetch https://streamsnip.com/uptime)
   ```

7. `!streaminfo` ADVANCED - this gives streaminfo in JSON format that you can use to do some other stuff.
   data looks something like this.

### Additional Customization:

You can use `-ul=userlevel` to limit clipping to specific user levels (e.g., mods). Find user levels [here](https://docs.nightbot.tv/commands/commands#advanced-usage) to reduce spam and grant clipping access to specific individuals.  </br>
